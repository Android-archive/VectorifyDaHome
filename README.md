# Description:

Vectorify da home! is a minimal and open source app to apply static Live Wallpapers generated from a vector image you can choose from a vaste collection!
You can edit the background and image colors using a fantastic Color Picker, presets ... or you can use the device accent color!

- Why a Live Wallpaper e not a wallpaper?

Because it is a faster method to update the background, without the need of having something that saves the wallpaper to your phone memory, and asking storage access permission.


- Why "static"?

Unlike classical Live Wallpapers, the image is not drawn (almost) continuously but only one time when the LP becomes visible (for example, when you come back to your home from an app or when you unlock the device). NO Battery draining!


- Where did the images come from?
